# This is a small lfs project 

## Made for fun not for actual use

This is a small lfs made for my enjoyment and fun. It's NOT meant to be
used since it contains many issues and has hardly anyting usable.

## Current working features

- working small shell with main commands
    (ls, cd, rm, mkdir, pwd, cp)
- small cli text editor
- eless 
    (program to print files on the shell)
- pseudo env variables (/bin, /usr/bin)
    now can call utilities from anywhere

## Current planned features? maybe? who knows

- better text editor
- c compiler

## Far fetched feature ideas

- custom basic language (barebones)
- more utility software (custom htop, etc)

## How to try it of (ya really out of your mind)

I use qemu as my virtualization platform but you can use what ever you want.

To try it with qemu run this command

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom iso/TeHeeOS-0.0.2.iso
