# This is a small lfs project 

## Made for fun not for actual use

    This is a small lfs made for my enjoyment and fun. It's NOT meant to be
    used since it contains many issues and has hardly anyting usable.

## Current working features

- working small shell with main commands
    (ls, cd, rm, mkdir, pwd)
- small cli text editor
- evenless 
    (program to print files on the shell)

## Current planned features? maybe? who knows

- better text editor
- fixing of some shell commands
- env support (mainly for PATH)
- c compiler

## Far fetched feature ideas

- custom basic language (barebones)
- more utility software (custom htop, etc)

## Testing of the lfs

    The iso image for the OS can be found found at

    `/linux/arch/x86/boot/image.iso`

    I mainly use qemu as my testing platform 
    but others can work too
